This folder mirrors `/Users/raph/.cargo/bin`. It exists to give control over the invocation of `rustc`, `cargo` and `rustfmt` by the IntelliJ Rust Plugin. Specifically, it currently forces `rustc` to take a known target and target-features when it is being queried for `--print cfg` by the plugin. This is because the plugin does not provide any way to prevent it just using the the native (host) machine's config when making decisions about which conditionally compiled code to highlight.
